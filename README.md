## About The Project
E-commerce website that allows users to purchase cookies online. There must be 6 or 12 cookies in the cart in order to checkout. Cookies in the cart are displayed with price, quantity and type. Quantity can be changed with arrows or the amount can be manually changed by typing. Once user is ready to checkout, they are redirected to Stripe's payment gateway that asks for shipping information. 
Depending on if cookies are in stock or not, the website may be up or temporarily suspended due to new flavors being added or restocking.
